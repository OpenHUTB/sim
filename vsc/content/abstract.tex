With the development of intelligent connected vehicles and unmanned vehicle technology, the human-vehicle simulator has become a core tool for intelligent vehicle research and development. However, current development faces pain points such as cumbersome environment configuration, mismatched tools, and fragmented processes. This paper selects the topic "VSCode Plugin System for Rapid Development and Verification of Human-Vehicle Simulator". Through methods such as literature research and modular development, a dedicated VSCode plugin is designed and implemented, integrating code completion, environment packaging, and linkage debugging functions to solve the problem of low development efficiency of human-vehicle simulators. This research fills the gap in dedicated development tools for human-vehicle simulators and has both theoretical innovation and practical value in teaching and R&D scenarios.

Key words: Human-Vehicle Simulator; VSCode Plugin; Development Tool; Intelligent Vehicle
