Focusing on the perception and decision-making demands in complex autonomous driving scenarios, this study proposes a visual object tracking and intention analysis algorithm that integrates an improved DeepSORT framework with a physical model. By introducing SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) features into the multi-object tracking architecture, the system effectively resolves the identity-switching challenges of traditional algorithms under occlusion and motion blur conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced algorithm achieves an IDF1 score of 86.5\% in dense traffic flows while reducing identity switches to zero. Leveraging the dynamic traffic environment constructed on the Carla simulation platform, a lightweight intention recognition model based on velocity-distance joint criteria is designed, enabling real-time hierarchical warnings for behavioral trends such as "dangerous approaching" and "moving away". The system integrates target detection, trajectory tracking, and intention analysis modules, with multi-dimensional visualization implemented via PyGame. Operating at a processing rate of 9.09 FPS, the feasibility of the algorithm is validated, offering a novel technical pathway for advancing autonomous driving perception systems from environmental awareness to behavioral prediction.
