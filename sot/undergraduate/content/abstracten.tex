    With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, enhancing perception and decision-making capabilities in complex traffic environments has become an important issue. Given that traditional tracking and behavior prediction algorithms find it difficult to balance accuracy and immediacy in high-density scenes, a visual object tracking and intent analysis system relying on the Carla simulation platform has been planned. The system integrates the DeepSORT multi-target tracking algorithm and uses Kalman filtering and deep appearance feature acquisition methods to achieve accurate tracking of dynamic targets. It also creates a motion intention recognition system based on a physical model. By analyzing the target speed and relative position, it can timely determine behavioral trends such as "approaching", "moving away", and "dangerous approaching". The experimental results show that the system has good immediacy and robustness in complex urban traffic scenarios, especially for situations where targets are obstructed and moving at high speeds. This research achievement provides a new direction for target tracking and intention estimation in autonomous driving visual perception, and has certain engineering application significance and expansion space.
