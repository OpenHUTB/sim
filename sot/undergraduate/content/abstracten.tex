    With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, enhancing perception and decision-making capabilities in complex traffic environments has become a crucial research focus. This study designs a vision-based target tracking and intention analysis system based on the Carla simulation platform to address the challenges of balancing accuracy and real-time performance faced by traditional tracking and behavior prediction algorithms in dense traffic scenarios. The system integrates the DeepSORT multi-object tracking algorithm, combining Kalman filtering and deep appearance feature extraction to achieve accurate and continuous tracking of dynamic targets. Additionally, a lightweight intention recognition mechanism based on physical modeling is developed, which analyzes the speed and relative position of targets to infer behavior trends such as "approaching," "departing," and "dangerous approach" in real-time. Experimental results show that the system maintains strong robustness and real-time performance, especially under conditions of occlusion and rapid motion in complex urban traffic environments. The proposed approach effectively improves the perception intelligence of autonomous vehicles, providing reliable support for decision-making and path planning. This research offers new insights and technical solutions for vision-based target tracking and intention analysis, with promising prospects for practical applications and further development in the field of intelligent transportation systems.
