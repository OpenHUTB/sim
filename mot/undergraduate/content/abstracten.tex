	As smart transportation advances, the demand for precise vehicle tracking technology is rising. In real - world traffic scenarios, conventional single - target tracking struggles to handle multiple targets simultaneously due to issues like target loss in complex scenes, inaccurate multi - sensor data fusion, poor model robustness, and low real - time performance.
	
	This paper is based on CARLAUE4, PyCharm and other software for experimental design to optimize multi-object tracking algorithms, specifically YOLOv5s and DeepSort. The paper integrates a Transformer module to improve YOLOv5s and employs ECA attention mechanism and RepVGG in DeepSort.
	
	After training YOLOv5s for multi - target detection and DeepSort for multi - target tracking, the paper conducts optimization experiments and ablation studies to evaluate performance improvement, proving the enhanced algorithm's effectiveness.
	
	Finally, the paper summarizes achievements and limitations and anticipates continuing research into multi - target tracking algorithm optimization in future graduate studies.
