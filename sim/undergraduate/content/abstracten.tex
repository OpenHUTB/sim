In the development of intelligent driving systems, the generation and optimization of simulation scenarios are crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability. This project reviews the technologies for generating and optimizing dangerous simulation scenarios in intelligent driving. Firstly, based on natural driving data, representative dangerous driving scenarios are identified and extracted, providing a data foundation for the construction of simulation scenarios. Secondly, through multi-dimensional scenario automatic extraction and fusion methods, typical driving scenarios such as line-following, following, and lane-changing are identified and integrated with dynamic driving scenarios to generate more complex and realistic test scenarios. Additionally, to address the issue of insufficient dangerous scenarios in existing test scenarios, a test case generation and enhancement method based on cluster analysis and importance sampling is proposed, which effectively improves the test coverage and efficiency of dangerous scenarios. Finally, an automated simulation testing platform has been developed, enabling the rapid construction of test scenarios, joint invocation of simulation software, and fully automated execution of result analysis and report generation. These methods can significantly improve the safety testing efficiency of intelligent driving systems in simulation environments, providing strong support for the further development of intelligent driving technology.
