    As deep learning technology advances rapidly, its application in complex environments is expanding. However, traditional model training and evaluation methods face significant challenges in these scenarios. This study explores a deep learning training and evaluation method based on virtual simulation technology to enhance model performance and reliability in complex environments. The advanced Carla virtual simulation platform was chosen for its high realism and customization, providing rich training resources and diverse testing scenarios for deep learning models.
    This paper reveals the potential of virtual simulation technology in deep learning training and evaluation, offering reference experience for future research. Despite the limitation that differences between virtual and real environments may affect model generalization, the findings provide valuable references for future exploration. Future research directions may focus on developing training strategies that better integrate virtual and real environments to enhance the practical application of deep learning models.
