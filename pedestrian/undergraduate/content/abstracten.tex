As urban traffic systems progress towards enhanced intelligence, the research and development of pedestrian navigation and control systems have gained increasing importance in traffic management and smart city infrastructure development. Traditional pedestrian guidance methods, often relying on rule-based models or basic path planning algorithms, are frequently insufficient in adapting to the dynamic and complex nature of urban environments.This limitation presents a hurdle in meeting the real-time and intelligent requirements of modern traffic systems. Recently, reinforcement learning, an AI technique proficient in adaptive learning of optimal strategies, has emerged as a potent tool for addressing decision-making challenges in dynamic environments.This specific research effort presents a new pedestrian navigation system based on Unreal Engine and Carla platform. It combines virtual simulation with reinforcement learning principles to enhance path planning and obstacle avoidance through adaptive learning.To comprehensively evaluate and compare its performance with traditional path planning algorithms, the system conducted a series of experiments in various simulation environments. The experimental results show that the pedestrian navigation system based on reinforcement learning significantly improves the efficiency of pedestrian obstacle avoidance and path planning in dynamic urban landscapes. This research not only expands the application scope of reinforcement learning in intelligent traffic systems but also provides innovative technical solutions crucial for the future development of smart cities.
