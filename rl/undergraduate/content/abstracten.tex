With the development of science and technology in today's world, people's demand for autonomous driving is getting higher and higher. Therefore, today's cars can no longer meet people's needs for today's complex driving environment. Digital twin technology, as a new type of simulation technology, has attracted people's attention. Digital twin technology provides people with an efficient and safe autonomous driving test platform by building a virtual environment relative to the real environment. Digital twins provide people with real-time feedback of environmental information by building a virtual environment. Digital twins provide people with support for autonomous driving model training through the real-time information provided. Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that can self-learn in a changing environment. It can help people complete the autonomous driving system. By combining digital twin technology with reinforcement learning algorithms, it can not only help us better develop and verify autonomous driving systems, but also improve the adaptability and safety of autonomous driving systems.

This article discusses the autonomous driving reinforcement learning simulation system based on digital twins. To show the great potential and power of combining digital twin technology with reinforcement learning algorithms in autonomous driving. Through this article, we can clearly see that digital twin technology can provide people with a virtual environment corresponding to the real environment to help people train autonomous driving models more safely and accurately. The reinforcement learning algorithm shows us how it helps the autonomous driving system to train the autonomous driving model more quickly and accurately.

This article first introduces what digital twins and reinforcement learning algorithms are, and then shows the basic algorithms and principles of digital twins and reinforcement learning. And shows the specific formulas of digital twins and reinforcement learning algorithms. Finally, it shows how I personally apply digital twin technology and reinforcement learning algorithms to train autonomous driving models in actual environments. By combining digital twin technology and reinforcement learning algorithms, I designed a self-driving model using different typical reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO and DQN. This self-driving model can realize self-driving in the Carla simulation environment. Realize my specific needs for the model.
